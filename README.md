#MIRCScraper

Python Scrapy project to get all of the images, metadata, and video URLS from The films on South Carolina's Moving Image Research Collection (MIRC). This was created for the need of information for MIRCSearch. MIRC uses Islandora with Solr search and it is difficult to get the raw information from such a high level system.
